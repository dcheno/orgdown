# Orgdown

A Python program written to reformat works written in Emacs Org Mode into shareable LibreOffice (.odt) files using standard manuscript formatting.

# Status

This is an in-progress project. Currently it will transform Part, Chapter, and Scene headings and reformat paragraphs, but even these functionalities are not yet fully tested.

Orgdown does not yet transform line formatting (bold, italic, underline) into .odt.
